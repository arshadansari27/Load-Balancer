The Project is currently being used for learning purposes only. It is more of a proof of concept, that touches a lot of latey in the development process.

The project is now trying to implement the probabilistic request based balancing model and its inspiration is taken from the following mentioned paper. I would like to thank the authors of the paper and express my gratitude.
